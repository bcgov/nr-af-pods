        <h4>Applications</h4>
        <p>
          Start a new application by clicking on the program stream that you
          would like to apply to. Your saved draft applications can be found on
          the 'My Applications' tab at the top of the page after sign-in. The
          system only allows for one draft application at a time. To start a new
          application, you must either submit or delete any previous drafts.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you accidentally start an application for the incorrect program
          stream, you can access and delete the draft in 'My Applications' in
          the top panel. You can then start a new application in the correct
          program stream. Unsubmitted (draft) applications will be automatically
          deleted from the system in 60 days after program intake closes.

          Claim forms for submitted applications can be accessed from the 'My
